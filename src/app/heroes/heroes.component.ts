//You always import the Component symbol from the Angular core library and annotate the component class with @Component.

  // Sweet Sweet Injection happens in the constructor
  // Add a private heroService parameter of type HeroService to the constructor.
  // The parameter simultaneously defines a private heroService property and identifies it as a HeroService injection site.

    // Reserve the constructor for simple initialization such as wiring constructor parameters to properties.
    // The constructor shouldn't do anything. It certainly shouldn't call a function that makes HTTP requests to a remote server as a real data service would.
  }
